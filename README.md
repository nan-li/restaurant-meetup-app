# ü•ë Meet + Eat: The *newest* Restaurant Meetup Platform

Meet + Eat is a great way to meet new people while dining at your favorite restaurants (or maybe even discover new restaurants!). In our app, users can search for restaurants available in the Yelp API and add favorable ones to their own favorites list. A user can then create an event at a restaurant, and all others who have favorited that restaurant will be notified of this new event. Others can RSVP to attend the event and modify their RSVP as well.

What a great way to meet new people! Users can view each other's profiles and send each other messages as well as interact in the comment thread for events.

# About the Founder|CEO|CMO|CFO|CTO
Nan Li holds a BA in Computer Science from the University of California, Berkeley. After graduating, she chose a different path than most of her peers. She found her passion in helping children make sense of math and helping students who profess to be ‚Äúnot math people‚Äù see themselves as capable mathematicians. She went on to receive a MA in Math Education from Stanford University and teach high school students. When a friend asked her to take CS50x (Harvard‚Äôs popular online introductory computer science course) together, Nan remembered the fun of problem solving and found a renewed interest in code.
